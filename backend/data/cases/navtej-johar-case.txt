Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)
A historic judgment that decriminalized consensual homosexual acts in India by striking down portions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.

Background:
Navtej Singh Johar, a renowned dancer, along with other prominent personalities filed a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the IPC which criminalized "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" - a provision primarily used to penalize homosexual relationships. This case followed the rollercoaster of previous judgments including the Delhi High Court's Naz Foundation ruling in 2009 (decriminalizing homosexuality) and Supreme Court's Suresh Kumar Koushal judgment in 2013 (re-criminalizing it).

Legal Questions:
1. Does Section 377, insofar as it criminalizes consensual sexual acts between adults in private, violate the constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, equality, and freedom of expression?
2. Should the Court overrule its previous decision in Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation?
3. Is sexual orientation an integral part of identity and dignity protected by the Constitution?

Arguments:
The petitioners argued that Section 377 violated multiple fundamental rights, including the right to privacy recently affirmed in the Puttaswamy judgment. They contended that sexual orientation was an immutable characteristic and an essential aspect of identity deserving constitutional protection.

The respondents, while not strongly defending Section 377, argued that the matter involved questions of social morality that should be left to Parliament.

Decision:
In a unanimous decision by a five-judge Constitution Bench, the Supreme Court partially struck down Section 377, decriminalizing consensual sexual conduct between adults in private. The Court held that:

- Sexual orientation is an intrinsic element of liberty, dignity, privacy, and equality
- The law cannot discriminate against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation
- Constitutional morality must prevail over social morality
- Section 377 was based on stereotypes and prejudice rather than constitutional principles
- The Court's duty is to protect fundamental rights of minority communities, regardless of popular opinion

The Court explicitly overruled its previous decision in Suresh Kumar Koushal, calling it "manifestly arbitrary."

Legacy:
The Navtej Johar judgment is considered revolutionary in recognizing LGBTQ+ rights in India. It established that sexual autonomy and freedom to choose one's partner are fundamental to human dignity. Beyond decriminalizing homosexuality, the judgment articulated a transformative constitutional vision that embraces diversity and condemns discrimination based on sexual orientation. It has become the foundation for further LGBTQ+ rights advocacy in India.
