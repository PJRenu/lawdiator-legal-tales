Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985)
A landmark case that expanded the interpretation of the right to life under Article 21 to include the right to livelihood and established rights for pavement dwellers and slum residents.

Background:
In 1981, the state of Maharashtra and the Bombay Municipal Corporation decided to evict pavement dwellers and slum residents in Mumbai (then Bombay) and send them back to their places of origin. Journalist Olga Tellis, along with other journalists and organizations, filed a writ petition challenging these evictions on behalf of the pavement dwellers.

Legal Questions:
1. Does the right to life under Article 21 include the right to livelihood?
2. Do pavement dwellers have any right to encroach on public pavements?
3. Does the procedure for eviction need to satisfy the requirement of being "just, fair and reasonable" under Article 21?

Arguments:
The petitioners argued that eviction would deprive the slum dwellers of their livelihood, as they lived on pavements to be close to their places of work. They contended that the right to life included the right to livelihood, and eviction without alternative arrangements would violate Article 21.

The state authorities argued that no person had the right to encroach on public property, and the evictions were necessary for urban planning and public interest.

Decision:
The Supreme Court delivered a nuanced judgment:
- It recognized that the right to life includes the right to livelihood, as no person can live without the means of living
- However, it held that this right could not be construed as a license to encroach on public property
- The Court acknowledged that people lived on pavements not by choice but out of necessity
- It directed that evictions could proceed but with conditions:
  * Evictions should not be carried out during the monsoon season
  * Those who had lived in censused slums since 1976 should be provided alternative accommodation
  * Pavement dwellers should be given notice and reasonable time before eviction
  * Evictions should respect principles of natural justice

Legacy:
The Olga Tellis case is regarded as a cornerstone of socio-economic rights jurisprudence in India. It established that the right to life encompasses more than mere animal existence and includes the right to live with dignity. While it didn't prevent evictions, it laid down procedural safeguards and recognized the state's obligation to provide resettlement in certain cases. The case became a foundation for subsequent public interest litigation on housing rights, forced evictions, and urban poverty. It exemplifies the Court's attempt to balance development needs with the protection of vulnerable populations.
