Vishaka and Others v. State of Rajasthan (1997)
A landmark judgment that established guidelines for preventing sexual harassment of women in the workplace before any legislation existed on this issue.

Background:
The case arose following the brutal gang rape of Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan who tried to prevent child marriage as part of her duties. Her subsequent victimization and denial of justice led women's rights organizations to file a petition addressing sexual harassment at workplaces.

Legal Questions:
1. In the absence of domestic legislation, could international conventions be relied upon to establish rights?
2. What constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace?
3. What are the obligations of employers to protect women from sexual harassment?

Arguments:
The petitioners argued that sexual harassment violated fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. They invoked CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women), which India had ratified.

The respondents argued that in the absence of specific legislation, the Court should not step into the domain of the legislature by creating new law.

Decision:
The Supreme Court recognized sexual harassment as a violation of fundamental rights to equality, non-discrimination, life, and liberty. In the absence of domestic law, the Court used its power under Article 141 to lay down binding guidelines known as the "Vishaka Guidelines," which included:

1. Definition of sexual harassment
2. Preventive steps employers must take
3. Complaint mechanisms employers must establish
4. Disciplinary action requirements
5. Awareness initiatives
6. Complaint committee structures

The Court explicitly stated these guidelines would be binding until appropriate legislation was enacted by Parliament.

Legacy:
The Vishaka Guidelines were followed for 16 years until the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act was passed in 2013. The case demonstrates the Court's willingness to fill legislative gaps to protect fundamental rights and its recognition of international conventions as interpretative tools. It remains a milestone in gender justice jurisprudence in India.
